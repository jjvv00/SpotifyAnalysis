## EDAV F23: Exploring Musical Tastes: A Data Analysis of Spotify Data and Song Moods 

Authors: Jaclyn Vu (jbv2118) & Ellise Parnoff (edp2139)

For our project, we aim to utilize Spotify API via "spotifyr," an R wrapper. With access to Spotify's API, we want to compare the top artists between Ellise and Jaclyn. We also would also like to explore the moods the tracks and albums of the top artists. Some of the variables of interest are valence, energy, and danceability.
