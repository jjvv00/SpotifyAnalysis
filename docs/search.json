    "title": "Exploring Musical Tastes: A Data Analysis of Spotify Data and Song Moods",
    "section": "",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nEveryone is unique and diverse. Music is a vast and dynamic landscape, and personal preferences and the emotional impact of songs can vary widely from person to person as well. We are in a digital age where streaming services dominate. This allows the availability of extensive music libraries. From these streaming services, APIs open up new avenues for exploring the diverse facets of musical tastes and emotional resonance in numbers.\nAs mentioned earlier, there are a multitude of platforms to stream music. Pandora, Apple Music, YouTube, Amazon, and Spotify are popular choices. In most of these platforms, users are not only listeners. They are the curators of their own musical experiences. In order to help each user curate their experience, these platforms read user data and make recommendations and playlists based on their listening preferences. One of the most popular apps is Spotify, and each year, Spotify releases trends for each user based on their listening pattern for the year called “Spotify Wrapped,” which was recently released! For this project, we will use the “spotifyr” package to access extensive data about songs from our top artists of the year. The “spotifyr” package is useful for developers to analyze the the emotions of an artist’s album and look at some insights of the user. However, we will only use the functions to access the artists’ data.\nOur decision to explore musical preferences through the Spotify R package is motivated by the desire to understand the intersection of personal taste, emotional connection, and shared musical experiences. By comparing the top tracks between two users, we aim to uncover similarities and differences that may reflect diverse musical journeys and influences. While it is unlikely to have an overlap between our top artists and tracks, it is the moods of the artists that could be insightful. Using the valence, energy, and danceability variables from “spotifyr,” we can compare the moods of artists’ albums.\nThis exploration not only contributes to our understanding of the intricacies of musical preferences but also sheds light on the emotional narratives woven into music. By combining data-driven insights from the Spotify R package, we aim to offer a comprehensive perspective on the intersection of personal, emotional, and shared experiences within the realm of music. Through this project, we hope to unravel the richness of musical expression and its profound impact on individual and collective identities."

    "text": "2.1 Technical Description\nWe will be accessing the Spotify Web API that provides us to a vast collection of music-related data. This could include information about tracks, albums, artists, and user-specific information. This data is collected and maintained by Spotify, a leading music streaming platform. Thus, we are assuming that Spotify is able to update the API frequently. There are not any obvious issues or problems with the data. We plan to retrieve data through the “spotifyr” R wrapper for pulling track audio features and other information from Spotify’s Web API in bulk (Thompson, Et al., 2022). The authors are Josia Parry, Donal Phipps, Tom Wolf, and Charlie Thompson, who also maintains the package. According to Thomposon’s Github, the last changes are from December 14, 2022.\nOur data is in the form of 4 dataframes, one for each of our top two artists. These data frames contain all of the songs for a specific artist (Taylor Swift, Fleetwood Mac, Doja Cat, and Peso Pluma). There are 39 features listed for each song. These range from basic descriptors such as song title, album, release date, to more complex features to describe the mood/tone of the songs. We will mainly utilize the danceability, energy, and valence scores for each song. The number of rows in each of these data frames is the total number of songs each artist has. Taylor Swift will have a data frame of 530 X 39. Fleetwood Mac has a data frame of size 760 X 39. Doja Cat has a data frame of size 91 X 39, and Peso Pluma has a data frame of size 57 X 39."

    "text": "2.2 Research Plan\nComparative Analysis of Top Artists:\nWe will analyze the top two artists for each of us provided by our Spotify Wrapped. While there are methods to extract user information from the Spotify API, Spotify recently released Spotify Wrapped as mentioned earlier, so we wanted to use that feature. Based on our Spotify Wrapped, Ellise’s top artists are Taylor Swift, Fleetwood Mac, Queens of the Stone Age, Bruno Mars, and Rihanna. For Jaclyn, her top artists are Doja Cat, Peso Pluma, SZA, Megan Thee Stallion, and Ariana Grande. For this project, we will be comparing the tracks and albums between our top two artists: Taylor Swift, Fleetwood Mac, Doja Cat, and Peso Pluma.\nExploring Album Moods:\nLeveraging the Spotify API’s audio features, particularly valence and energy, we can analyze the mood dynamics of artists’ albums. Valence represents the musical positivity, while energy represents the intensity and activity. By aggregating these features at the album level, we gain insights into the overall emotional content of each album. The Spotify R package allows us to extract and process this information efficiently, enabling us to explore patterns and themes in the emotional landscape of diverse artists. By utilizing the get_audio_features function from the “spotifyr,” we can obtain the valence, danceability, and energy features for each track. Then. we can aggregate these features at the album level to represent the overall mood. Lastly, we can analyze patterns and trends in mood dynamics across different artists’ albums."
